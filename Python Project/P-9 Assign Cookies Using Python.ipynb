    "- Here You will be given a list of children with their greed factor and a list of cookies with their size.  To slove this problem , you need to assign each child a cookie such that the child's greed factor is less than or equal to the size of the cookie. \n",

    "* Number of children with freed factors (g) : [1,2,3]\n",
    "* Number of cookies with their sizes (s) : [1,1] Output : 1\n",

    "- In Above example, there are two cookies with size1 , But only one child with desired cookies size of 1. So even though there are two cookies. Only one child can be satified . That is why the ouput return 1, as only one cookie is needed to satisfy the one child with a desired size of 1."
